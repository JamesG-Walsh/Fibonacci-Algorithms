# Fibonacci Algorithms

Western University - CS3340B Winter 2021 - Assignment 1

F(n) = the nth Fibonacci number

## Usage
* `make` - compiles the program
* `make runA` - Calculates and prints every 5th Fibonacci number up to F(50) using an inefficient recursive algorithm in exponential O(2^n) time.
* `make runB` - Calculates and prints every 20th Fibonacci number up to F(500) in O(n) time
* `make runB_flex` - Calculates and prints F(20,000), F(40,000), F(60,000), F(80,000), and F(100,000) in O(n) time
* `make clean` - cleans up when finished
